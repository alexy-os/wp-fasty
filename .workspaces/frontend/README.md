# Frontend Component Library

## Overview

This directory contains a next-generation, reusable component library built with React and Tailwind CSS 4. The primary goal is to empower developers to:

1. Rapidly prototype and build UIs using atomic, semantic-first components
2. Automatically extract clean, semantic HTML and CSS from utility-based React components
3. Centralize design tokens for effortless theming and global style consistency
4. Enable seamless integration with AI/LLM-driven workflows for maximum productivity and accuracy

## Architecture

Our architecture is designed for the future of UI development, combining the speed of utility-first workflows with the clarity and maintainability of semantic HTML. Components are composed like Lego blocks—atoms, molecules, and organisms—while all design tokens and icons are managed centrally for instant, project-wide updates.

### Key Features

- **Semantic-First Output**: Components render with clear, semantic class names (e.g., `button button-primary button-lg`) instead of utility class clutter
- **Automated Extraction**: CLI tools parse your React components (using CVA/cn patterns) and generate semantic CSS and components automatically
- **Centralized Design Tokens**: All colors, radii, and other tokens are defined in a single location for easy theming
- **Framework Agnostic Output**: Semantic HTML and CSS can be used in any environment or template engine
- **AI/LLM-Ready**: Minimal, precise code structure is easy for both humans and AI to understand, extend, and prototype

## Technical Setup

### Tailwind 4 Integration

Tailwind 4 is used for rapid development and prototyping. Utility classes are leveraged during development, but are automatically converted to semantic classes in production builds.

Key Tailwind 4 advantages:
- No PostCSS configuration required
- Built-in CSS nesting support
- Custom variants using `@custom-variant`
- Simplified theme configuration via `@theme`
- Improved color function support

### React Configuration

React components are written using modern best practices (TypeScript, hooks, composition). The system supports atomic design principles and enables easy composition of complex UIs from simple building blocks.

## Component Design Philosophy

Our components follow a "utility-to-semantic" conversion pattern:

1. Components use Tailwind utilities and CVA/cn patterns for rapid prototyping
2. Rendered HTML uses semantic class names (e.g., `button-primary`)
3. CLI tools extract and compile styles into clean CSS with semantic selectors
4. The resulting HTML and CSS are framework-agnostic and follow W3C standards

### Example: Button Component (React)

```tsx
import { cva } from 'class-variance-authority';

const buttonVariants = cva('button', {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90',
      secondary: 'bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground',
      // ...
    },
    size: {
      default: 'h-9 px-4 py-2',
      lg: 'h-10 px-6',
      sm: 'h-8 px-3',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    variant: 'primary',
    size: 'default',
  },
});

export function Button({ variant, size, ...props }) {
  return <button className={buttonVariants({ variant, size })} {...props} />;
}
```

**After extraction:**

```html
<button class="button button-primary button-lg">Click me</button>
```

And the corresponding CSS:

```css
.button-primary {
  @apply bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90;
}
.button-lg {
  @apply h-10 px-6;
}
```

## From Utility to Semantic HTML & CSS

This library demonstrates a revolutionary approach to component development:

1. **Development**: Use Tailwind and CVA/cn for rapid, atomic development
2. **Extraction**: Automated scripts parse components and extract semantic CSS
3. **Compilation**: Clean, maintainable CSS and HTML are generated for production
4. **Output**: Semantic, accessible, and framework-agnostic markup

### Why This Matters
- **Consistency**: Centralized tokens and automated extraction guarantee pixel-perfect, consistent UIs
- **Maintainability**: Semantic HTML is easier to read, debug, and extend
- **AI/LLM Synergy**: Minimal, predictable code structure is ideal for AI-driven prototyping and code generation
- **Performance**: Smaller, cleaner HTML and CSS improve load times and accessibility
- **Portability**: Use the output in any framework, CMS, or static site generator

## Usage

### Development

```bash
# Start the development server
bun run dev

# Generate semantic CSS and components
bun run semantic

# Extract component CSS
bun run extract-css
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Generate production CSS
bun run tailwind
```

## Integration Examples

This component library can be used with:
- React/Next.js applications
- WordPress themes via PHP includes
- Static site generators
- Vue/Angular/other frameworks
- Server-side rendering frameworks
- Headless CMS systems

The compiled CSS and extracted component templates provide a flexible, future-proof foundation for any frontend project while maintaining clean, semantic markup.
